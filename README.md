# A welcome word

We truly believe that this pandemic is the fight of our lives. If you haven't
yet, please visit [our website](www.covoucher20.org).

We are mitigating the economic effects of lockdowns to support local businesses
and their livelihoods. From the example of the Great Depression, millions of
people are at risk of losing their homes, and they need those homes to contain
the virus. To avoid that, we believe that that software and the internet are our
best weapon against the virus.

In peace time, we may pivot towards helping local businesses fill their spare
capacity.

In the words of Kate Atkinson: when this pandemic passes, let it be said that
the CoVoucher team rose to the challenge and we were not found wanting.

# Contributing

We select the right people into our team by requiring initial volunteer work en
route to part-time or full-time employment. CoVoucher is a do-ocracy: if you
have an idea, do it; when we're motivated by love, we can never fail, we can
only improve what already exists.

If you want to join the cause with our own dedicated slack workspace, please
message contact us at [our website](https://covoucher20.org/contact) including:
- your CV
- a track record of your portfolio
- what is it, deep down, that motivates you
- "proof of work": something concrete and tangible that improves CoVoucher20 in
some way; this can be a change in the CSS code of our website, a typo we should
fix, an idea for advertisement, etc.

If you submit code, the following guidelines may be helpful:

- We will assess the application by first looking at the result, and then
  assessing the changes with a `git diff`, so include the date or the commit
  hash from which you are making changes.
- Keep your code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself). Code is more often read than
  written; while code is initially an asset, it quickly becomes a liability when
  we need to maintain it.
- Always use the latest version of the website or the source code, so we avoid
  merging two branches of development.
- Inspect our style and copy it, so your changes are 100% related to features
  and we spend our code review entirely on your real contribution (we will not
  review changes from tabs to spaces, for example).
- We frown upon the use of front-end javascript, which we view as an
  accessibility barrier and an attack vector; you may break this rule, of
  course, if you are creative enough to make it worth considering and if you
  keep "progressive enhancement", i.e. making sure that the website works well
  without javascript.
- Include the sentence "I assign the intellectual property of this contribution
  to CoVoucher20.org and The CoVoucher Authors." so we are legally allowed to
  integrate it into our code base.
