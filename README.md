# A welcome word

We truly believe that this pandemic is the fight of our lives. If you haven't
yet, please visit [our website](www.covoucher-20.com).

We are mitigating the economic effects of lockdowns to support local businesses
and their livelihoods. From the example of the Great Depression, millions of
people are at risk of losing their homes, and they need those homes to contain
the virus. To avoid that, we believe that that software and the internet are our
best weapon against the virus.

We select the right people into our team by requiring initial volunteer work en
route to part-time or full-time employment. CoVoucher is a do-ocracy: if you
have an idea, do it; when we're motivated by love, we can never fail, we can
only improve what already exists. We have share vesting for contributors, where
the measure is the increase in the company's balance sheet from the person's
contribution, and an option pool for early employees. Generosity is our motto,
just like our users. We are all in this together.

In peace time, we may pivot to a mix between Groupon and AirBnB, where local
businesses can fill their spare capacity.f

In the words of Kate Atkinson: when this pandemic passes, let it be said that
the CoVoucher team rose to the challenge and we were not found wanting.
