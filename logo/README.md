A dove flying is a symbol of travel, escape, and going places.

A dove is a universal sign of hope and peace. It is also a reference to Noah's
Ark: in biblical mythology, all beings had to spend 40 days in confinement and
carried with them the survival of mankind; the dove was the bearer of good news,
that the quarantine is not forever, and that life will resume at a future place and time.

The handwritten font emphasizes the connection to local businesses such as "Ma
and Pa shops."

The color teal is connected to heart initiation (008080).
